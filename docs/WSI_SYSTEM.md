## Usage Examples

### General Query
**User:** "What is WattCoin?"

**WSI:** "WattCoin is a Solana utility token powering the decentralized AI agent economy. We're building a network where AI agents can earn WATT by completing tasks, improving code via our PR bounty system, or contributing compute through WattNode. The token serves as the 'electricity' that powers coordination between autonomous agents. Total supply is 1 billion WATT, and we're currently at ~$15K market cap but growing through organic utility..."

### Technical Help
**User:** "How do I submit a PR to earn WATT?"

**WSI:** "Great question! Here's how to earn WATT via our PR bounty system:

1. Find a bounty issue on GitHub (labeled 'bounty')
2. Fork the repo and make your improvements
3. Submit a PR with this format:
   - **Payout Wallet**: [your_solana_address]
   - Description of changes
4. AI will auto-review your PR (needs score ≥8)
5. After merge, payout is queued for admin approval

Current bounties range from 50K-100K WATT. Check out docs/PR_BOUNTY_SYSTEM.md for details!"

### Network Participation
**User:** "How can I run a WattNode?"

**WSI:** "Running a WattNode is coming soon! Phase 1 focuses on CPU inference. You'll:
- Stake WATT to join
- Contribute CPU/GPU resources
- Earn 70% of job revenue
- Help power this very intelligence you're talking to

For now, you can earn WATT through PR bounties and prepare by holding stake. Follow @WattCoin2026 for WattNode launch updates!"
