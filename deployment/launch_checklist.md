# WattCoin Launch Checklist - February 1, 2026
## 2026 AI Meta Relaunch | Pure Utility Focus

## T-72 Hours: FINAL PREPARATION ✅
- [x] Smart contract audited and tested on devnet (0.15% burn rate optimized)
- [x] Pump.fun metadata reviewed and approved
- [x] Deployment script validated for 2026 Solana infrastructure  
- [x] AI webhook endpoints tested (multi-model ready)
- [x] Dashboard operational on Railway
- [x] Budget allocation confirmed ($5K locked, 2026 market-aligned)
- [x] Airdrop tracking system implemented (10M WATT for beta users)
- [x] Deployment simulation completed (90/100 readiness score)

## T-4 Hours: LAUNCH SEQUENCE ⏰
### Phase 1: Mainnet Deployment (30 minutes)
- [ ] Execute `./deployment/deploy.sh mainnet` with 0.15% burn rate
- [ ] Verify program deployment on Solana Explorer (v1.18 compatibility)
- [ ] Test burn mechanism with small transaction (confirm 0.15% rate)
- [ ] Confirm AI webhooks pointing to mainnet contract

### Phase 2: Pump.fun Launch (60 minutes)  
- [ ] Create Pump.fun listing with 2026 AI meta positioning
- [ ] Fund initial liquidity pool ($2K allocation)
- [ ] Post utility-focused announcement (Tesla AI5 compatibility, TAO/FET bridge ready)
- [ ] Activate real-time monitoring dashboard

### Phase 3: Beta User Activation (120 minutes)
- [ ] Invite 10 beta testers to dashboard
- [ ] Execute first AI-verified tasks (target: AI integration live)
- [ ] Monitor 0.15% burn rate activation
- [ ] Process initial airdrop claims (10M WATT total)

## SUCCESS METRICS - Week 1 Targets (2026 Adjusted)
- **Transactions**: 50+ per day (utility usage baseline, 2026 AI agent activity)
- **Burn Rate**: 0.015% supply burned daily through actual usage (1.5x 2025 target)
- **Beta Tasks**: 10+ AI-verified task completions (Tesla AI5 + traditional)
- **Dashboard Users**: 10 active utility users
- **Airdrop Recipients**: Maximum 10 verified task completers
- **AI Platform Integration**: 3+ platforms actively transacting

## MONITORING ALERT CONFIGURATION (2026 Enhanced)
### Red Flag Triggers (Auto-alerts)
- **Transaction Volume**: <50 daily transactions 
- **API Health**: >5% failure rate on webhooks (Tesla AI5 included)
- **Burn Rate**: <0.01% daily (indicates insufficient utility usage)
- **Error Threshold**: >10 failed task verifications/day
- **Market Cap Alert**: <$25k (below utility threshold)

### Response Actions
- **<50 txns by EOD Feb 2**: Activate 5 additional beta contacts + Tesla AI5 demo
- **API failures**: Immediate webhook debugging, activate backup endpoints
- **Low utility usage**: Review Tesla AI5 integration, user feedback collection
- **Budget overage**: Pause non-essential services, maintain core functionality

## CONTINGENCY PLANS (2026 Updated)
- **Solana Network Issues**: Delay 24h, deploy February 2 (network more stable than 2025)
- **Pump.fun Problems**: Direct DEX listing via Jupiter/Raydium as backup
- **Low Initial Usage**: Activate Tesla AI5 demonstration tasks
- **Integration Failures**: Rollback to devnet, debug with 2026 API standards

## POST-LAUNCH 48H MONITORING (Enhanced)
- [ ] Track transaction volume and 0.15% burn rate effectiveness
- [ ] Monitor AI integration performance (Railway logs + Solana explorer)
- [ ] Process verified airdrop claims via airdrop_claims.json  
- [ ] Document any technical issues vs. 2025 architecture
- [ ] Prepare Week 1 utility report (compare to TAO/FET benchmarks)
- [ ] Test Tesla AI5 payment integration readiness

## 2026 MARKET POSITIONING CHECKLIST
- [ ] Emphasize utility-first approach (no meme speculation)
- [ ] Highlight TAO/FET compatibility timeline (Q3 2026)
- [ ] Position as Tesla AI5 payment infrastructure
- [ ] Document burn rate increase rationale (scarcity in mature AI market)
- [ ] Track performance vs. AI token sector (FET/TAO/AGIX comparison)
